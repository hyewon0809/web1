      <h2>Terminology</h2>

      <p>In many English-speaking countries outside North America,
      including the United Kingdom, the most common word for a crisp cookie is biscuit.
      The term cookie is normally used to describe chewier ones.
      However, in many regions both terms are used.
      The container used to store cookies may be called a cookie jar.</p>

      <p>In Scotland the term cookie is sometimes used to describe a plain bun.
      Cookies that are baked as a solid layer on a sheet pan and then cut,
      rather than being baked as individual pieces, are called in British English
      bar cookies or traybakes.</p>
